You can have the same MAC address receive traffic for multiple open ports, ports are logical, whilst MAC addresses are physical. They are also situated in different layers, MAC addresses belong with [ARP/ND](obsidian://open?vault=Computers%20-%20Infinity%20Stones&file=Networking%2FConceptual%2FARP%20%26%20ND), whilst ports belong to [TCP/IP](obsidian://open?vault=Computers%20-%20Infinity%20Stones&file=Networking%2FConceptual%2FTCP%20-%20IP), which is in the third layer.
