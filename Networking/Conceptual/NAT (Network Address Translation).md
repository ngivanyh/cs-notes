Rewrites packets in flight. When a host sends traffic through a NAT device, that device rewrites the response so that it goes to the original client. It maintains a table of connections and tracks the state of each connection so that it can properly open and close connections as needed. Most routers are NAT devices. (Only in IPv4 to conserve IPs, basically one IP, points to many hosts since they can change the address)
