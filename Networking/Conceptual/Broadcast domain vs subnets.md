Sharing a "ethernet" is different from being in the same subnet. Sharing an ethernet implies that host you're trying to connect to is in your **broadcast domain** and you likely can connect as it's in your ARP/ND tables. But you can be in the same **subnet** and might not have previously connected to the host that you want to connect to now (ARP/ND tables to populated with that host's MAC address)
