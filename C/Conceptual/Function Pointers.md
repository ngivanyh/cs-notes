Pointers to functions can be assigned, placed in arrays, passed into functions, returned by functions and so on. (basically like a normal pointer)

Format: `RETURN_TYPE (*NAME)(INPUT_ARGS)`

The `()` are needed for `NAME` as without it, it now means a function who'll return a pointer pointing to a value of `RETURN_TYPE`.
